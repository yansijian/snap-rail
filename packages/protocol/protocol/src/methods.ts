/**
 * The unary method table: signatures are the single source of truth. The map
 * registers the methods themselves; every other position (gateway handlers,
 * clients, schemas, tests) references the derived generics. Adding a method:
 * one interface signature + one map row + one schema pair + one route.
 *
 * Reserved-method discipline: the map holds only implemented methods; an
 * unknown method fails loud at dispatch (`bad-request`) — no
 * not-implemented fallback code.
